.SH NAME
.B hella shell
- a simple command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
command [-o option_name] [command_file [argument ...]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hella_shell
is a simple command line interpreter based on the first Unix shell 'sh', created by Ken Thompson in 1971. hella_shell is intentionally minimalistic and contains functionality for only the most basic shell tasks - accepting input, parsing the input into a command and its arguments, and executing that input. Error checking is simple and follows Bash conventions.
.SH INVOCATION

If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal the shell is considered an interactive shell.  An interactive shell gen‐
erally prompts before each command and handles programming and command errors differently. When first starting, the shell inspects argument 0. 

If command line arguments besides the options have been specified, then the shell treats the first argument as
the name of a file from which to read commands (a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as the posi‐
tional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc).  Otherwise, the shell reads commands from its standard input.
